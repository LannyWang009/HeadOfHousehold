# Head Of Household
This is the first front-end group project for the DigitalCrafts Flex Class. This project features a web application that will allow the head of household to break down the family chores and assign them to family members. Family members are able to view their coming-up chores in a calendar and change the status as they finish. Our app's mission is to improve household efficiency and to relieve the head of household(whether the mom or dad)'s pain of choir assignment and frequent oral reminders.
